Python Automation System

In these Project, I have tried creating an automation system in Python which performs some tasks using the in-built voices in windows. The user can interact with the system through the input microphone and can give some specificÂ tasks to the system which are pre-defined inside a program such as sending an e-mail, playing music and much more....
I have used a wide range of libraries in this project such as speech recognition, wikipedia, os, web browser, smtplib, datetime and pyttsx3 etc.
